              except the mentioned below will be declined. This Refund Policy is
              a part of, and incorporated within, the Terms of Use. As a
              condition using the services offered through this site, you
              expressly acknowledge that you have read and understood this
              Refund Policy and you agree to be bound by its terms and

              In the event you would like to cancel your order then the refund
              depends on the situation whether the tutor starts working on it or
              not. Please, note that, in case the tutor has begun working on
              your order, a full refund will not be possible. However, you will
              still be able to get a partial refund. It depends on how much work
              the tutor has completed by the time of your refund request. If
              your order has been completed, it cannot be canceled.

              We always confirm only for the works which can be fulfilled by our
              tutors. Although hundreds of tutors are available, we may still
              not be able to find a tutor who is qualified to complete your
              work. This may sometimes happen with technical & long work needed
              at short notice. We will normally do everything to designate a
              suitable tutor to do your work. However, if we are unable to find
              a tutor for you, you are entitled to a full refund.

              This situation is very rare on our website due to high student
              satisfaction rates. However, in the event that a student feels our
              services do not meet the expectations, you can request a free
              revision or request for refund. Refunds are available if you and
              the tutor both agree that one is appropriate. If you fail to reach
              an agreement, there will be no refunds. Privacy Policy
